# Project Vision

## Summary
A general-purpose CLI Python script that checks Canvas LMS courses in any set of SIS terms to see if a specified external tool is enabled in the course navigation. The tool ID, term IDs, and output file are all configurable.

## Goal
Generate a CSV report listing all courses where the specified tool is enabled, including term_id, course_id, and course_name.
